# Project02:- House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

# About the Project:-

This project predicts house prices using Linear Regression on a Kaggle dataset. The dataset is cleaned by encoding categorical values, split into training and testing sets, and then trained. The model is evaluated using R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Graphs are used to visualize accuracy and prediction results. A custom function is also created to predict prices for new input values.

# Steps Followed:-

1. Load the dataset (Housing.csv)
2. Preprocess data (convert categorical values to numbers)
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train model using Linear Regression
5. Evaluate model performance (R², MAE)
6. Visualize accuracy and predictions
7. Predict new house prices using custom function

# Note

This is a mini project for learning machine learning basics and applying Linear Regression for real-world datasets.
